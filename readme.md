# Testing SIGINT with gRPC Streaming

This demonstrates the issue where SIGINT cannot interrupt a gRPC streaming call that's waiting for data.

## The Problem

When a gRPC client is blocked waiting for the next message in a stream (via `.each` or `enum.next`), sending SIGINT will **not** interrupt it. The gRPC Ruby library explicitly catches and ignores interruptions in its completion queue, retrying the wait.

This is exactly what happens in the Spanner `execute_partition_update` hang:
1. Client iterates through streaming results (`results.rows.to_a`)
2. Server stops sending data mid-stream
3. Client blocks in `@enum.next` waiting for next partition result
4. SIGINT is sent but ignored
5. Only a timeout (like Semian's 10s) or network failure ends the wait

## Setup

### Using the Debug-Instrumented gRPC Gem

To see the detailed logging that proves the retry behavior, you need the debug-instrumented version of gRPC:

1. **Clone the debug branch**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b debug https://github.com/samuel-williams-shopify/grpc.git
   cd grpc
   git submodule update --init
   ```

2. **Build and install the gem**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   gem build grpc.gemspec
   gem install grpc-1.77.0.dev.gem
   ```

The debug branch includes instrumentation in `src/ruby/ext/grpc/rb_completion_queue.c` that logs:
- When `unblock_func` is called (SIGINT received).
- Each iteration of the retry loop.
- When the loop decides to retry despite interruption.

## Running the Test

**Terminal 1 - Start the server:**
```bash
ruby server_slow_stream.rb
```

This server will:
- Send the first message immediately
- Then hang forever (simulating a stuck Spanner partition)

**Terminal 2 - Run the test client:**
```bash
ruby test_sigint.rb
```

## Expected Output

With the debug-instrumented gRPC gem, you'll see detailed logging that proves the retry behavior:

```
Starting gRPC streaming test...

üî• THE SMOKING GUN:

[GRPC DEBUG] Loop iteration 1: interrupted=1, RETRYING LOOP (ignoring interruption!) ‚Üê ‚úó gRPC ignores it!
[GRPC DEBUG] Loop iteration 2: Resetting interrupted to 0

... 28 seconds pass until timeout ...

[2025-10-01 21:53:53 +1300] ‚ùå DeadlineExceeded: Stream timed out
[2025-10-01 21:53:53 +1300] SIGINT was received: true
[2025-10-01 21:53:53 +1300] But the stream continued until timeout!
```

## Key Observations

1. **SIGINT is delivered** - `unblock_func called! Setting interrupted=1`.
2. **Ruby signal handler executes** - The `Signal.trap` block runs successfully.
3. **gRPC sees the interruption** - `interrupted=1` is set.
4. **üî• gRPC deliberately retries** - `interrupted=1, RETRYING LOOP (ignoring interruption!)`.
5. **Loop continues** - `Loop iteration 2: Resetting interrupted to 0`.
6. **Timeout is the only escape** - 30-second deadline finally ends it.

This proves that both Ruby and gRPC are working as designed - Ruby delivers the signal, but gRPC's completion queue explicitly ignores interruptions and retries.

## The Root Cause

From [`src/ruby/ext/grpc/rb_completion_queue.c`](https://github.com/samuel-williams-shopify/grpc/blob/debug/src/ruby/ext/grpc/rb_completion_queue.c):

```c
static void unblock_func(void* param) {
  next_call_stack* const next_call = (next_call_stack*)param;
  next_call->interrupted = 1;  // ‚Üê SIGINT sets this flag
  fprintf(stderr, "[GRPC DEBUG] unblock_func called! Setting interrupted=1\n");
}

grpc_event rb_completion_queue_pluck(grpc_completion_queue* queue, void* tag,
                                     gpr_timespec deadline,
                                     const char* reason) {
  // ...
  do {
    next_call.interrupted = 0;  // ‚Üê Reset flag
    fprintf(stderr, "[GRPC DEBUG] Loop iteration %d: Calling rb_thread_call_without_gvl\n", loop_count);
    
    rb_thread_call_without_gvl(grpc_rb_completion_queue_pluck_no_gil,
                               (void*)&next_call, unblock_func,
                               (void*)&next_call);
    
    fprintf(stderr, "[GRPC DEBUG] Returned, interrupted=%d\n", next_call.interrupted);
    
    if (next_call.event.type != GRPC_QUEUE_TIMEOUT) break;
    
    if (next_call.interrupted) {
      fprintf(stderr, "[GRPC DEBUG] interrupted=1, RETRYING LOOP!\n");  // ‚Üê The problem!
    }
  } while (next_call.interrupted);  // ‚Üê If interrupted, LOOP AGAIN!
  
  return next_call.event;
}
```

The loop explicitly retries after interruption, making SIGINT/SIGTERM ineffective.

### Why This Exists

According to the code comment, this was added to handle [grpc/grpc#38210](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/38210). The retry loop prevents spurious interruptions from breaking gRPC operations, but it also means legitimate interrupt signals (like SIGINT/SIGTERM) are ignored.

## Solution

For the Spanner issue, the fix is:
1. **Don't use Partitioned DML** for single-row updates
2. Use `execute_update` in a transaction instead
3. This avoids the multi-partition streaming problem entirely

## Timeline

This test was created to diagnose why a Google Cloud Spanner `execute_partition_update` call hung and couldn't be interrupted with SIGINT. The investigation revealed:

1. **The hang**: Partitioned DML was used for a single-row update (primary key lookup)
2. **The symptom**: SIGINT didn't interrupt the hanging operation
3. **The cause**: gRPC's completion queue deliberately ignores interruptions
4. **The proof**: This test with debug logging shows the retry behavior
5. **The fix**: Switch from Partitioned DML to regular transactional DML for single-row operations
